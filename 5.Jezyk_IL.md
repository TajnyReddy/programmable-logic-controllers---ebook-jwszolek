##Asembler language
The instruction list (IL)is an assembler-like IEC 61131-3 conformal programming language.
This language supports programming based on an accumulator. The IEC 61131-3 operators are supported as well as multiple inputs / multiple outputs, negations, comments, set / reset of outputs and unconditional / conditional jumps. IEC 61131-3 is the third part of the international standard describing PLC languages. It provides for the possibility of combining subroutines written in different languages ​​within one project. IEC 61131 languages are low level languages that share a lot of elements.
##Accumulator 
In a computer's central processing unit (CPU), the accumulator is a register in which intermediate arithmetic logic unit (ALU) results are stored. 
Accumulator usually it is used for: 
-loading values from PLC memory cells into it 
-performing mathematical/logical operations 
-storing temporary results 
-copying the battery status to selected memory cells 
#Need for an accumulator in older computing systems 
Accumulator is one of the fastest registers in the processor and without it, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation to main memory which is slower. And there are reasons why accumulators are one of the fastest registers in the processor: 
-It’s directly connected to the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 
-Hardware optimizations
-Simplicity of the register controller 
-Compatibility with programming languages
 The ability to use general-purpose registers as arguments and result locations is dictated by practical considerations when executing code, namely that additional shifts are not needed to perform the desired operation, which consumes processor time. Additionally, the use of the accumulator register significantly simplifies the processor architecture, which was important in the early development of electronics and may play a role in very simple microcontrollers. 
 #Evolution of accumulators 
 However, as computing and CPU technology advanced, the accumulator became obsolete. Newer computing architectures and multicore designs usually avoid the term accumulator and more often reference a general-purpose register. Also, modern CPUs are usually 2-operand or 3-operand machines where more general-purpose registers are used for these additional operands.  
The registers are used as the source and destination for calculations, which is why they aren't considered accumulator machines. In modern computers, any general-purpose register can function as an accumulator since it offers greater flexibility. However, accumulators are still used in some special-purpose processors for intermediate data storage, for example many single-chip microcontrollers (PIC, 8051) have accumulators.
The letter “A” from “accumulator” is preserved in the names of the registers AX, EAX, RAX.
#Accumulator in IL language 
Accumulator (A) is the basis of IL language operation. It can handle various data types (BOOL, INT, REAL) and it’s the size of a machine word. It’s important to remember that data for one operation must always be of the same type. The operations that can be performed with the accumulator typically include various arithmetic and logical operations which will be described in the following parts. 
##Memory instructions
Each instruction is primarily based on the loading of values into the accumulator by using the LD operator. After that the operation is executed with the first parameter taken out of the accumulator. The result of the operation is available in the accumulator, from where you should store it with the ST instruction.
Basic Operations:
-LD memory1 (from LOAD) - load the state of the memory1 cell into A
-ST memory2 (from STORE) – save the state A to the address memory2
Example:
The contents of memory location %M1 are written to %Q2
LD %M1 
ST %Q2
The contents of register %R3 are written to the analog output %AQ1
LD %R3 
ST %AQ1
Some other operators:
-JMP - jump to the label
-CAL - call of a PROGRAM or FUNCTION_BLOCK
-RET – return
Some operators may differ slightly depending on e.g. PLC model.

Using N modifier is negation of the operand (not of the accumulator):

##Bit instructions
In PLC, the most commonly used operations on bits are: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR, BIT_SET, BIT_CLR, BIT_TEST and BIT_POS.
AND - if the next bit in argument one and the corresponding bit in argument two are 1, then 1 will be received at the corresponding position in the output.
OR - the next position in the output will be 1 if in at least one of the
corresponding arguments occurred 1.
XOR - If the bits in corresponding arguments are different, than 1 shall occur in the corresponding position in the output
NOT - In the output the opposite of went in the input will be received
SHL - It causes bits to be shifted left
SHR - it causes bits to be shifted right
ROL - cyclical bit shift to the left
ROR - cyclical bit shift to the right
BIT_SET - it sets the certain amount of bits in bit sequence to 1
BIT_CLR -  it sets the certain amount of bits in bit sequence to 0
BIT_TEST - checks the value of the selected bit in bit sequence. for this function, you must specify the address of the first IN input from which testing begins and the number of the bit being tested
BIT_POS - it checks the position of first non 0 bit in sequence
##Stos
A stack 
is a linear memory structure that operates according to the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. Access to the stack occurs exclusively through the stack's top. It is used to store data needed for performing specific operations. For example, when addition is performed, the values of two operands are placed on the stack. After the operation is executed, the result is removed from the stack.
It also stores values of local variables. Local variables are variables declared within a code block. They are stored on the stack to allow access to them within the code block in which they were declared.
Operations on the stack are triggered using the characters "(" and ")", which mean respectively: saving the contents of the accumulator onto the stack and loading data from the top of the stack into the accumulator.
Example:

| Code | Accumulator | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| LD_BOOL we1 | we1 |  |
| AND we2 | we1 and we2 |  |
| OR ( |  | we1 and we2 |
|    LD_BOOL we3 | we3 | we1 and we2 |
|    AND we4 | we3 and we4 | we1 and we2 |
|    ) | [we3 and we4] or [we1 and we2] |  |
| ST_BOOL wy2 |  |  |

##Conditional Jumps
JMP in IL works similarly to GOTO in C++. This command skips part of the code until it finds a specified label.  However, unlike in C++ jumps in IL are very useful, since IL doesn’t have an if command. Because of that jumps in IL are used as a replacement for if.
It has 3 variations:
-JMPC which executes the jump if the accumulator equals 1.
-JMPCN which executes the jump if the accumulator equals 0.
-JMP which executes the jump without any requirements.
Example:
LD_BOOL wy7  (*accumulator *)
JMPC here   (*if wy7=1, the program skips all the code until it reaches the line with “here:”*)
…       	         (*if wy7=0, the program doesn’t skip any lines *)
…
here:              (*when the jump reaches its destination, it resumes to executing the code as normal*)
